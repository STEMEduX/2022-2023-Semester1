1. Type the attached program exactly as it is written (including not omitting any space) in https://replit.com python program space as we did the class;
2. Run the program and answer following questions:
a. One student (Clara?) in the class said when rolling dice, the probability of each number on the die to show is equal. For a die with 6 sides, the probability should be 1/6. However, in the class, we rolled 6 times, 5 and 4 showed up twice, 3 didn't show up and another two numbers showed only once. It seems the probability is not 1/6 i.e. 0.166667. What is wrong?
b. Please roll the dice as many times as you can using the simple_dice.py program so that the probability of each number to show would be closer to 1/6. How many times do you have to roll so that the probability of each number to show would be in between 0.14 and 0.18? Can you get the probability number even closer to 0.1666667? Why?
c. Can you change line 11 in the program to sides = 4 then run the program? How if you change it to sides = 20?

Note: for 2a, you would need to count how many times the program rolls, and the times of each number show. The probability of each number shows equals to (the times of each number show divided by total times the program rolls).
